# J124 Final Project: Impacts of Alcohol on Multiple Aspects of Life
## By: Darren Chiang

_5 Questions with Step by Step Answers on the following Data Sheet_ <br/>
**Question 1: How do weekly study times (studytime) and free time after school (freetime) affect both workday alcohol consumption (Dalc) and weekend alcohol consumption (Walc)?** <br/>
1. First press on any cell and insert a pivot table by pressing insert and select pivot table and create table in new sheet.
2. Once the pivot table is open, select stjdytime as rows, freetime as columns, and Dalc and Walc using the average function on both as the values. This will allow us to see how weekly study times and freetime affect alcohol consumption on both weekdays and weekends.

* The Pivot Table should look like this.


* **As shown, the pivot table indicates that as studytime increases from 1 to 4, there is a general trend of reduced average workday alcohol consumption (Dalc) and weekend alcohol consumption (Walc).
This suggests that students who dedicate more time to studying tend to consume less alcohol on both weekdays and weekends. Additionally, we can conclude that students with not a lot of free time (freetime=1), there seems to be a decrease in average alcohol consumption as studytime increases. Conversely, for students with a lot of free time (freetime=5), the pattern of alcohol consumption remains relatively consistent across different studytime levels. It is evident that students who are able to make a healthy balance between study and leisure time (moderate studytime and freetime values) generally demonstrate moderate alcohol consumption. This could potentially infer that maintaining a healthy balance between academic commitments and personal time requires one to be more responsible with their alcohol consumption.
